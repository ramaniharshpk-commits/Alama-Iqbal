          <h1>Nationel poet of Pakistan</h1>
          <p><b>Sir Muhammad Iqbal</b> (9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938) was an Islamic philosopher and poet. His poetry
            in Urdu is considered to be among the greatest of the 20th century, and his vision of a cultural and
            political ideal for the Muslims of British India is widely regarded as having animated the impulse for the
            Pakistan Movement. He is commonly referred to by the honorific Allamah (Persian: علامه, transl. "learned")
            and widely considered one of the most important and influential Muslim thinkers and Islamic religious
            philosophers of the 20th century.

          <p>Iqbal was born and raised in Sialkot, Punjab, British India and studied at Scotch Mission College in
            Sialkot and Government College in Lahore. He taught Arabic at the Oriental College, Lahore, from 1899 until
            1903, during which time he wrote prolifically. Notable among his Urdu poems from this period are "Parinde Ki
            Faryad" ("A Bird's Prayer"), an early contemplation on animal rights, and "Tarana-e-Hindi" ("Anthem of the
            Indians"), a patriotic poem—both composed for children. In 1905, he departed from India to pursue further
            education in Europe, first in England and later in Germany. In England, he earned a second BA at Trinity
            College, Cambridge, and subsequently qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. In Germany, he obtained a
            PhD in philosophy at the University of Munich, with his thesis focusing on "The Development of Metaphysics
            in Persia" in 1908. Upon his return to Lahore in 1908, Iqbal established a law practice but primarily
            focused on producing scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy, and religion. He is most
            renowned for his poetic compositions, including "Asrar-e-Khudi," "Rumuz-e-Bekhudi," and "Bang-e-Dara." His
            literary works in the Persian language garnered him recognition in Iran.</p>

          <p>An ardent proponent of the political and spiritual revival of the Muslim world, particularly of the Muslims
            in the Indian subcontinent, the series of lectures Iqbal delivered to this effect were published as The
            Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam in 1930. He was elected to the Punjab Legislative Council in
            1927 and held several positions in the All-India Muslim League. In his Allahabad Address, delivered at the
            League's annual assembly in 1930, he formulated a political framework for the Muslim-majority regions
            spanning northwestern India, spurring the League's pursuit of the two-nation theory.

          <h2>Death of ALLAMA IQBAL - April 1933</h2>
          <p>In August 1947, nine years after Iqbal's death, the partition of India gave way to the establishment of
            Pakistan, a newly independent Islamic state in which Iqbal was honoured as the national poet. He is also
            known in Pakistani society as Hakim ul-Ummat (lit. 'The Wise Man of the Ummah') and as Mufakkir-e-Pakistan
            (lit. 'The Thinker of Pakistan'). The anniversary of his birth (Youm-e Weladat-e Muḥammad Iqbal), 9
            November, is observed as a public holiday in Pakistan.
